        "1. What are the key differences between SQL and NoSQL databases?\n",
        "- The key differences between SQL (relational) and NoSQL (non-relational) databases lie in their data models, scalability, schema flexibility, and use cases:\n",
        "\n",
        "Data Model:\n",
        "\n",
        "- SQL Databases: Employ a relational model, organizing data into structured tables with predefined schemas, where relationships between tables are established using primary and foreign keys.\n",
        "\n",
        "- NoSQL Databases: Utilize various non-relational data models, such as document (e.g., MongoDB), key-value (e.g., Redis), wide-column (e.g., Cassandra), or graph (e.g., Neo4j). They offer more flexibility in data structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "Scalability:\n",
        "\n",
        "- SQL Databases: Primarily scale vertically, meaning performance is enhanced by increasing the resources (CPU, RAM) of a single server.\n",
        "- NoSQL Databases: Are designed for horizontal scaling, distributing data across multiple servers or nodes, which allows for easier scaling out to handle large volumes of data and traffic.\n",
        "\n",
        "Schema Flexibility:\n",
        "\n",
        "- SQL Databases: Enforce a strict, predefined schema, requiring data to conform to specific table structures and data types. Changes to the schema can be complex.\n",
        "- NoSQL Databases: Offer schema flexibility, often referred to as \"schemaless\" or \"schema-on-read,\" allowing for dynamic changes to data structures without requiring a predefined schema. This is well-suited for unstructured or semi-structured data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Consistency and Transactions:\n",
        "\n",
        "- SQL Databases: Typically adhere to ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, ensuring strong data consistency and reliable transactions, making them suitable for applications requiring strict data integrity (e.g., financial systems).\n",
        "- NoSQL Databases: Often prioritize availability and partition tolerance over strict consistency (following BASE – Basically Available, Soft state, Eventually consistent – principles), making them suitable for applications where high availability and performance are paramount, even if it means eventual consistency.\n",
        "\n",
        "Use Cases:\n",
        "\n",
        "- SQL Databases: Ideal for applications requiring complex queries, strong data integrity, and well-defined relationships, such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, financial applications, and traditional web applications.\n",

        "- In MongoDB, indexes are crucial for enhancing query performance by enabling faster data retrieval. They act as a roadmap for the database, allowing it to quickly locate documents based on indexed fields, thus avoiding full collection scans. Instead of sifting through every document, MongoDB can use the index to pinpoint the relevant data directly, significantly reducing query execution time.\n",
        "\n",
        "7.  Describe the stages of the MongoDB aggregation pipeline\n",
        "- The MongoDB aggregation pipeline consists of multiple stages that process documents in a sequence, with the output of one stage serving as the input for the next. Each stage performs a specific operation to transform, filter, or analyze the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is sharding in MongoDB? How does it differ from replication.\n",
        "- In MongoDB, sharding distributes a large dataset across multiple machines (shards) to handle large volumes of data and high throughput, while replication creates copies of the data on multiple servers for redundancy and high availability. Sharding is for scaling horizontally, while replication is for redundancy and fault tolerance.\n",
        "\n",
